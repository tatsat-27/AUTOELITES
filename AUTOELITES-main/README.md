# AUTOELITES

This is a website that me and my teammates created as a mini project.
We made a website to sell used super and luxury cars. In this project we have used HTML for the basic infrastructure of the website , then used appropriate CSS to make the website more
decorative and eye catching and used JavaScript to make the website functional and validation of parameters . In this project , we have stored the information of the clients (customers) in a database (used Oracle 10g XE).
